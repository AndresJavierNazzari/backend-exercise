# Class 11 Homework

## Following a Domain Centric Architecture, with the Domain models designed from the Previous homework (on class 10) create a ASP.NET Core Web API

Implement the API for a specific Domain model. You can implement for more than one but at least the implementation for one is required

- GET and POST is a must, the rest is optional
- Prefer using in memory collection as database, nevertheless using MYSQL, PostgresSQL, SQL Lite is also allowed

NOTE: Ypu can use othe ideas generated from the design process from the previous workfow if it helps


The focus of this excercise is on the implementation of the API, so it is not necessary to use a database, since we will be covering that topic later. But as mentioned it is allowed
