Generic Data Storage System:

## Create a generic data storage system that can store and retrieve different types of data using C# generics, the only constraint is that these types of data need to have a default constructor

Features:

1. Generic Data Storage Class:
- Define a generic class called DataStorage<T> that can store items of any type T, consider the constraint indicated before. This class should internally use a collection (e.g. a List<T>)
2. Methods:
- Implement methods to Add, Remove, and Retrieve items from the data storage.
- Implement a method to display all items in the storage
3. Console Application:
- Create a console application that uses the DataStorage<T> class to store and retrieve different types of data
