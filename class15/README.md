# Class 15 Homework

## This is a continuation of the preovious exercise.

Add validations for the controllers implemented:

- 
- Add validations for properties that are required or should be
- Add validations for the constraints of the properties, for example: the Name property should be of 200 characters
- Add valdiations to logic that is related to your application's business logic. For example: Goals can only live for one year, this means start and end date should be in that range

You can use your preferred way to handle validations but the recommendation is to go for Fluent Validation

Add versioning to your API
